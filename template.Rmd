I'm an R Markdown document! Creates a new session everytime you knit. Will add plot in the
file.

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 3
Going to make a plot. First I generate dataframe and then use 'ggplot' to make a scatterplot
```{r chunk_scatterplot}
plot_df = 
  tibble (
    x = rnorm(n=1000),
    y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(n=1000)
  )


ggplot(plot_df, aes(x=x, y=y))+ geom_point()

```


#Section 4
```{r chunk_histogram}
la_df = 
  tibble (
    norm = rnorm (n = 500, mean = 1),
    logical = norm > 0,
    abs_norm = abs(norm)
  )

ggplot(la_df, aes(x=abs_norm)) + geom_histogram()
```

Here's a list:
* list item 1
* list item 2
